    * Data Library pannel
    * Workflow building pannel

* Part 2 - **Data analysis**:
    * Data upload:
        * data upload using 'upload file'

## PART 1
## Quick introduction to Galaxy

---
layout: false
## Galaxy : a workflow managment software
* Galaxy is a web interface providing scientists, tools usually launched through command lines 
* **Basics** :
    * A galaxy tool is a program linked to a xml file
    * The XML file gathers options, types, inputs, outputs, formats and the tool command line.
    * Galaxy interprets the xml to generate the web interface 
* **Advantages++** :
    * Deals with Big Data
    * Creates workflows (tool chains) 
    * Enables saving and sharing workflows and data
* Galaxy@Pasteur is available at **galaxy.pasteur.fr**:
    * It is available for internal users since March 2013 and external users since October 2016
    * It provides standard tools for bioinformatics analyses
    * as well as workflows for phylogenic analyses
    * It is linked to the Institut Pasteur storage bay:
        * Logged/registered users have a 10Gb quota
        * Anonymous users have a 2Gb quota

## Upload a data
<img src="../images/upload.png">

* Use the tool **Upload File**
    * Data in Galaxy have a type/format
    * Pay a good attention to the file format and the selected Genome (for genomic data)

* Remark
    * This tool is adapted for dataset below 2 Go
